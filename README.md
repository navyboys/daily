* A todo application with charts, video chat and Github integration. Aimed to be an todo hub which provide centralized control to assigned tasks in separated places like Github Issues, Trello and Pivotal Tracker, as well as provide data analysis features to help users improving their personal productivity or planning skills.
* Final project collaborated with @richardattfield for [Lighthouse Labs](http://lighthouselabs.ca), which is an 8-week web developer bootcamp that focuses on the longterm success of their graduates.

### Skills

- Without using the technologies we learned and practiced more during previous 7 weeks of the bootcamp, @richardattfield and I chose almost everything new to us to challenge, from javascript's **asynchronous programming** to the new architecture of different frameworks and tools: **NodeJS**, **Express**, ORM middleware named **Bookshelf** with **Knex** on the API sever, and the **React** and **Redux** on the front end with **Passport** for OAuth authentication with Github. We spent almost half of the time to learn these new things from start and suffered a lot. Everything is challenging, but we do learned a lot during this process. It deserved.
